"""Unified run-lineage package — the four-table provenance store.

Records what every workflow run did: which blocks executed, which data objects
they consumed and produced, and the environment they ran in. Everything is
written by the engine into a single SQLite database, so block authors never
have to touch the lineage layer directly.

Exports:

* :class:`LineageStore` — the SQLite-backed store holding the four tables.
* :class:`LineageRecorder` — the engine-side writer that listens for block
  events and fills the store as a run proceeds.
* :class:`RunRecord`, :class:`BlockExecutionRecord`, :class:`DataObjectRow`,
  :class:`BlockIORow` — dataclasses mirroring the four tables.
* :class:`EnvironmentSnapshot` — a capture of the Python and package versions a
  run used.
* :class:`RunContext` (with :func:`get_run_context`, :func:`set_run_context`,
  :func:`reset_run_context`) — a thread/task-local handle to the active run.

There is no in-memory provenance graph; query the store with SQL instead.
