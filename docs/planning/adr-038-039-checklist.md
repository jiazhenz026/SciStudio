# ADR-038 + ADR-039 Implementation Checklist

> **Mandatory tracking doc.** Every agent edits the rows it owns and only those rows.
> Drift = protocol violation. The dispatcher (Claude as agent manager) sweeps after every phase.
> Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/whimsical-soaring-pascal.md`. Session start: 2026-05-15.

## Conventions

- `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked
- "Owner" is the agent role or "manager" for hands-on work
- Each row references the relevant ADR section in `[brackets]`
- When you tick a box, also append a one-line note: `→ <PR-or-commit-link>` or `→ <test-name passes>` or `→ <report-file-path>`
- Out-of-scope rules per agent are encoded in `docs/planning/dispatch-prompts/` (one prompt file per agent)

## Manager discipline (non-negotiable for this cascade)

1. Every `Agent` dispatch uses `isolation: "worktree"`, `model: "opus"`, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`.
2. **MANDATORY (user direction 2026-05-15)**: After every Agent dispatch, the manager MUST immediately enter a foreground `until` loop polling for the next concrete artifact. Never reply "Waiting" and let the stop-hook fire repeatedly. Pattern: `until [ -n "$(git ls-remote origin '<branch-pattern>' 2>/dev/null)" ]; do sleep 60; done` or `until [ -f <report-path> ]; do sleep 60; done`.
3. Worktree isolation forbids `pip install -e .` from within the worktree (see `feedback_editable_install_contamination`).
4. Every `pytest` invocation uses `--timeout=60`. Plugin (`pytest-timeout`) is already in dev deps.
5. No `npm run dev` background processes — use `vitest run` and `npm run build`.
6. Every agent PR body contains `Closes #N`.
7. CI must be green before any agent reports done.
8. Mandatory live Chrome smoke for any UI-touching phase before report-done.
9. Codex P1/P2 findings on agent PRs override auditor "defer" calls — manager fixes in-PR per overnight merge protocol.
10. Tracking-branch convention: agent feature branches target the tracking branch (NOT main); umbrella PR `[DO NOT MERGE]` per track points to main for visibility only.

---

## Phase 1 — Preflight (Owner: manager)

- [x] Re-sync main: `git checkout main && git pull origin main` (main at `0cc8a8f` Phase 0 docs merge)
- [x] Tool checks: python 3.13.12, pytest 9.0.2, ruff 0.15.9, mypy 1.20.0, node v24.14.0, npm 11.9.0, gh 2.89.0, claude 2.1.142 — all on PATH
- [x] `python -c "import scieasy; print(scieasy.__file__)"` → `src/scieasy/__init__.py` (clean, not editable-install contamination)
- [ ] Chrome MCP probe (deferred to Phase D38-3.1b / D39-3.1 audit + Phase 4 e2e where it's mandatory)
- [x] Discipline hook present at `scripts/hooks/remind-checklist-discipline.sh`; `.claude/settings.json` wires it to PostToolUse on Edit/Write/MultiEdit/TaskCreate/TaskUpdate/TaskStop/TodoWrite (verified from `.claude/settings.json` lines 30-46 during Phase 0)
- [x] Tracking branch created: `track/adr-038/lineage-db` off main, pushed to origin (commit 7c1ae58 seed)

- [x] Umbrella PR `[DO NOT MERGE]` opened from `track/adr-038/lineage-db` to main with checklist link → https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/pull/912
- [x] Umbrella PR `[DO NOT MERGE]` opened from `track/adr-039/git-versioning` to main with checklist link → https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/pull/913
- [x] CI baseline checked (main commit 0cc8a8f workflows queued; #909 tracks pre-existing Python 3.11 flake; no other regressions)

---

## ADR-038 — Unified Run Lineage DB (track/adr-038/lineage-db)

### Phase D38-2.1 — Code-scope audit (Owner: AD38-1, no-context agent)

- [ ] Audit agent dispatched with ADR-038 + main-tree only; explicit instruction "no session context"
- [ ] Scans entire repo for: `MetadataStore`, `metadata_store`, `metadata.db`, `LineageStore`, `LineageRecord`, `LineageRecorder`, `lineage.db`, `_persist_output_metadata`, `block_version` defaults, `lineage_id`, `framework.lineage_id`, `BLOCK_DONE` consumers/producers, `api/deps.py::get_lineage_store`, `tests/.../test_lineage*`
- [ ] Report at `docs/audit/2026-05-15-adr-038-code-scope-audit.md` with file×symbol×line table marking "in ADR §5.2" vs "newly discovered"
- [ ] Manager folds newly-discovered files into D38-2.2 / 2.3 / 2.4 owned-file lists before dispatch

### Phase D38-2.2 — Wire-up + schema (Owner: ID38-2, 1 agent, refactor) [ADR-038 §6 Phase 1]

- [x] Sub-issue opened, branch `feat/issue-920/d38-2-2-wire-up-schema` off `track/adr-038/lineage-db` → https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/issues/920
- [x] `src/scieasy/core/lineage/` new package: `__init__.py`, `store.py` (4-table), `record.py`, `recorder.py` (moved from engine/), `environment.py`, `run_context.py`; `graph.py` DELETED per ADR §3.4 [ADR-038 §3.1, §5.1]
- [x] `src/scieasy/engine/scheduler.py` — construct LineageRecorder; extend BLOCK_DONE event data (`config`, `block_type`, `block_version`, `environment`, `input_object_ids`, `output_object_ids`, `inputs`) [ADR-038 §3.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/engine/lineage_recorder.py` — relocated to `core/lineage/recorder.py`; engine path is a re-export shim for one minor-version compat window [ADR-038 §5.1, §5.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/engine/runners/local.py` — lift `environment` from worker envelope into event data via `__scieasy_env__` sentinel (scheduler pops before downstream blocks see it) [ADR-038 §5.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/api/runtime.py::start_workflow` — create RunRecord, construct LineageRecorder, pass to DAGScheduler, finalize on completion via `_finalize_lineage_run` task callback [ADR-038 §3.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/api/runtime.py::create_project` — `.scieasy/` replaces legacy `checkpoints/`+`lineage/` scaffold dirs
- [x] `src/scieasy/api/deps.py::get_lineage_store` — rewrite to return the unified store owned by `ApiRuntime` (no per-request store allocation) [ADR-038 §5.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/api/app.py` — register `runs` router placeholder for D38-2.4a [ADR-038 §5.2]
- [x] `src/scieasy/blocks/registry.py` — force-inject `block_version` from `importlib.metadata` (cached `packages_distributions`); in-tree blocks stamp `scieasy.__version__`; no `"unknown"` default [ADR-038 §3.3]
- [x] `src/scieasy/cli/main.py` — `init` scaffold list parity with `runtime.py::create_project`
- [x] `tests/engine/test_lineage_recorder.py` + `tests/core/test_lineage*.py` + `tests/api/test_deps.py` + `tests/cli/test_cli.py` — migrated to new schema
- [x] Smoke test `tests/core/test_lineage_store_4table.py` passes: 3-block linear workflow produces 1 run + 3 block_executions + 3 data_objects + 5 block_io rows (linear DAG: A has no input → 5 not 6; spec note inline)
- [ ] CI green
- [ ] PR merged into `track/adr-038/lineage-db`

### Phase D38-2.3 — Collapse metadata.db (Owner: ID38-3, 1 agent, migration) [ADR-038 §6 Phase 2]

- [x] Sub-issue opened, branch off tracking branch after D38-2.2 merged → [#929](https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/issues/929)
- [x] `src/scieasy/core/metadata_store.py` → 6-month deprecation shim re-exporting unified store + DeprecationWarning [ADR-038 §5.2] → [PR #929 — deprecation shim](https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/pull/929)
- [~] `src/scieasy/core/meta/framework.py` — `FrameworkMeta.lineage_id` populated with `block_execution_id` in run context [ADR-038 §3.2, §5.2] → `with_lineage_id` helper added; end-to-end stamping escalated on #929 (requires moving allocation site from recorder to scheduler per ADR §3.2 — core/lineage/ is out of scope for D38-2.3)
- [x] `src/scieasy/engine/scheduler.py::_persist_output_metadata` — write to new `data_objects` table [ADR-038 §5.2] → [PR #929](https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/pull/929)
- [x] `src/scieasy/engine/checkpoint.py` — relocate `<project>/checkpoints/` to `<project>/.scieasy/pause/`; docstring clarifies pause/resume scope vs lineage [ADR-038 §5.2] → [PR #929 — checkpoint_dir_for relocation in api/runtime.py](https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/pull/929)
- [x] Project-open auto-creates lineage.db if missing; no historical metadata.db migration (per user direction 2026-05-15) → existing D38-2.2 wiring honoured; legacy metadata.db detection logs INFO line and is otherwise ignored
- [ ] Tests pass; CI green; PR merged into tracking branch

### Phase D38-2.4a — Backend REST + AIBlock rename (Owner: ID38-4a, 1 agent) [ADR-038 §6 Phase 3 backend]

- [x] Sub-issue opened; parallel with D38-2.4b → [#933](https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/issues/933)
- [x] `src/scieasy/api/routes/runs.py` (NEW) — GET /api/runs, GET /api/runs/{run_id}, GET /api/runs/{run_id}/methods, POST /api/runs/{run_id}/rerun [ADR-038 §3.7, §3.8] → branch `feat/issue-933/d38-2-4a-backend-rest`
- [x] `src/scieasy/core/lineage/methods_export.py` (NEW) — markdown methods renderer [ADR-038 §5.1] → branch `feat/issue-933/d38-2-4a-backend-rest`
- [x] `src/scieasy/blocks/ai/ai_block.py` — rename internal `run_id` → `block_execution_id` [ADR-038 §5.2] → branch `feat/issue-933/d38-2-4a-backend-rest`
- [x] `src/scieasy/blocks/ai/run_dir.py` — rename path to use `block_execution_id` [ADR-038 §5.2] → branch `feat/issue-933/d38-2-4a-backend-rest`
- [x] Pytest covers all 4 routes (happy path + 404 + validation errors) → `tests/api/test_runs_routes.py` (20 tests) + `tests/core/test_methods_export.py` (10 tests)
- [ ] CI green; PR merged into tracking branch

## Phase 3.5 — Cross-track integration audit (Owner: A35 — 1 agent)

> Added 2026-05-15 by user direction. Runs **after** D38-3.2 and D39-3.2
> are merged into their respective tracking branches, **before** Phase 4
> e2e. Catches integration-layer drift that the per-track audits
> structurally cannot see.

### Why this phase exists

The Phase 3 audits (D38-3.1a / D38-3.1b / D39-3.1) scope each track
independently. They cannot detect issues that only manifest at the
integration boundary between ADR-038 and ADR-039:

- `runs.workflow_git_commit` exists in the lineage schema (ADR-038) but
  the git engine (ADR-039) is the only source of the SHA value — must
  be wired through `start_workflow` (D39-2.5 owns this wiring).
- `runs.workflow_dirty` flag depends on `git_engine.status().dirty` —
  same wiring chain.
- Lineage tab "Restore this run's workflow" button (ADR-038 §3.8) is
  supposed to call `gitRestore({commit_sha: run.workflow_git_commit, files: [workflow_yaml_path]})` (ADR-039 §3.5) — frontend cross-slice
  call.
- Agent commit prefix `agent:` (ADR-039 §3.4a) must be emitted by the
  AI Block flow (ADR-035) and the PTY embedded coding agent (ADR-034) —
  verify on the real code paths.
- `frontend/src/store/index.ts` registers both `lineageSlice` and
  `gitSlice` — verify no naming collisions or selector overlap.
- `src/scieasy/api/runtime.py::start_workflow` is touched by D38-2.2
  (LineageRecorder wire) AND D39-2.2b (pre-run auto-commit hook) AND
  D39-2.5 (the SHA-to-runs.workflow_git_commit field write). Verify
  the call order, the error-handling interleave, and the on-failure
  fallback semantics for each combination of (dirty tree, lineage
  recorder available, git engine available).
- `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` `git.head_changed` event handler
  exists (D39-2.1) but should also invalidate the Lineage tab's runs
  query (so external git commits surface in the UI). Verify the
  handler reaches both slices.
- `BlockRegistry.hot_reload()` should fire on git branch switch (per
  ADR's "blocks alongside git" doc). Verify event wiring.

### Owned files (whitelist — audit only, NO code modification)

NEW audit output:
- `docs/audit/2026-05-15-adr-038-039-integration-audit.md` — categorized
  finding list (P1 must-fix-before-integration / P2 should-fix / P3 nit),
  one row per integration concern, with file + line citations.

The agent does NOT edit any source file — fix lands in the dedicated
Phase 3.5 fix step that runs **after Phase 4 e2e** per user direction.

### Audit scope (the agent's mandatory checklist)

Section A — backend wiring:
- [ ] `start_workflow` interleave of LineageRecorder (D38) + pre-run auto-commit (D39): order correct, exceptions in either side don't poison the other, both inputs to `RunRecord.workflow_git_commit` flow correctly.
- [ ] `create_project` / `open_project`: both auto-init lineage.db (D38) and auto-init git repo (D39); on failure of either, degraded mode is correct.
- [ ] `runs.workflow_git_commit` field populated end-to-end on every `start_workflow` call (no `None` / `""` leaks).
- [ ] Agent commits emit `agent:` prefix from both ADR-035 (AI Block) and ADR-034 (PTY) flows. Grep for prefix usage.
- [ ] EventBus `git.head_changed` events fire and reach both gitSlice (UI badge) and lineageSlice (run-list invalidation).
- [ ] `BlockRegistry.hot_reload()` triggers on branch switch.

Section B — frontend cross-slice:
- [ ] `store/index.ts` registers both slices without selector collision.
- [ ] Lineage tab "Restore this run's workflow" calls `gitRestore` correctly.
- [ ] `useWebSocket.ts` `git.head_changed` invalidates both slice caches as needed.
- [ ] Toolbar / BottomPanel mount both Git + Lineage components without layout clash.
- [ ] `Toolbar.tsx` shows GitStatusBadge + BranchPicker simultaneously with `BottomPanel.tsx` Lineage tab.

Section C — schema / contract:
- [ ] `lineage.db.runs` schema present in DB after Phase D38-2.2 + D38-2.3 chain.
- [ ] `block_version` force-injection (D38-2.2) does not break any block subclass shipped in `packages/scieasy-blocks-{imaging,lcms,srs}/`.
- [ ] `metadata.db` deprecation shim still answers reads correctly from agent MCP tools (ADR-033 `inspect_data` / `get_lineage` / `preview_data`).
- [ ] `If-Match` / `bump_revision` removal (D39-2.1) didn't leave dangling consumers in `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` or anywhere else.

Section D — file conflicts between tracks:
- [ ] `src/scieasy/api/runtime.py` final state has both D38 and D39 wirings present and ordered correctly.
- [ ] `frontend/src/store/index.ts` final state has both slices registered.
- [ ] `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` final state handles both `lineage.*` events (if any) and `git.head_changed`.
- [ ] `src/scieasy/api/app.py` lifespan correctly initializes lineage store + git watcher in the right order.

Section E — Codex review reconcile:
- [ ] Walk every Codex auto-review comment posted on every cascade PR (track/adr-038 + track/adr-039). For any comment marked "deferred", re-evaluate whether it's an integration-blocker and reclassify.

### Definition of done

1. Audit report at `docs/audit/2026-05-15-adr-038-039-integration-audit.md`.
2. P1/P2/P3 categorization per finding.
3. PR opened against `main` titled `chore(audit): D3.5 integration audit for ADR-038/039 cascade` (audit-only PR, no code changes).
4. All CI green.
5. Codex reconciled.

### Phase 3.5 fix (runs AFTER Phase 4 e2e per user direction)

After Phase 4 e2e completes, manager folds Phase 3.5 audit findings +
Phase 4 e2e findings into a single fix pass. P1 findings fixed before
final integration PRs to main. P2/P3 filed as follow-up issues if not
release-blockers.

- [ ] Phase 3.5 audit dispatched
- [ ] Audit report merged
- [ ] (Post-Phase 4) P1 findings from audit + e2e fixed
- [ ] Final integration PRs unblocked

---

## Test phase checklist (e2e — manager runs in hotfix mode)

### Phase 4a — ADR-038 e2e (Chrome smoke)

- [ ] Chrome opens via `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp` → SciEasy GUI on free port
- [ ] Create new project `e2e-038`
- [ ] Generate synthetic bead TIFF (256×256, ~5 ellipses, ~6741 bright px; reuse fixture from ADR-036 e2e sub-test (d))
- [ ] Build workflow in GUI: `imaging.load_image → imaging.threshold(otsu) → imaging.save_image`
- [ ] Save workflow YAML; click Run **5 times**
- [ ] Click "Run from here" on `threshold` block once (creates 6th run with `execute_from_block_id`)
- [ ] Open Lineage tab

**Pass criteria:**

- [ ] **(a)** Each of 6 runs answers ADR-038's 4 user questions through Lineage tab UI: workflow YAML snapshot, block list with versions, per-block resolved params, per-block I/O DataObject references visible by clicking the row
- [ ] **(b)** "Run from here" run has `execute_from_block_id = "threshold_<n>"` and `parent_run_id` pointing to a prior run; upstream blocks greyed-out per ADR §3.6a
- [ ] **(c)** GUI visual check matches ADR §3.8 layout (two-pane runs list + run detail); click handlers respond correctly
- [ ] **(d)** "Export methods" produces markdown file matching `methods_export.py` template
- [ ] **(e1)** Delete `<project>/.scieasy/lineage.db` while GUI closed; reopen project; new empty db auto-created; Lineage tab shows "no runs yet" without crash
- [ ] **(e2)** Delete a block from canvas, save workflow, re-add the block, save again; Lineage tab still displays all prior runs (block_executions rows preserved)
- [ ] **(e3)** Delete workflow YAML file from disk; reopen project; Lineage tab still shows all prior runs of that workflow (workflow_yaml_snapshot inline in `runs` table per ADR §3.1 — confirms user's recollection)
- [ ] **(f)** Open AI chat in GUI; ask "Show me lineage for last 5 runs of image_pipeline — list each run's blocks, params, outputs"; agent writes SQL against `<project>/.scieasy/lineage.db`; compare to ground truth from direct `sqlite3` query
- [ ] **(f-followup)** If agent fails or hallucinates, file follow-up issue to update agent system prompt
- [ ] GIF recorded via `mcp__claude-in-chrome__gif_creator`

### Phase 4b — ADR-039 e2e (Chrome smoke)

- [ ] Create new project `e2e-039` with same bead workflow
- [ ] Add `hello_world` custom block via GUI (ADR-036 "New custom block" affordance), trivial pass-through body

**Test 1 — manual + auto + manual commits:**

- [ ] Click Commit button — manual commit 1 created
- [ ] Click Run — pre-run auto-commit: clean tree → no commit; force dirty edit → Run again → `auto:` commit fires
- [ ] Delete threshold block from canvas, save, click Commit — manual commit 2
- [ ] History panel with default filter "Manual milestones" shows 2 commits
- [ ] Filter "All" shows 3 commits (2 manual + 1 `auto:`)

**Test 2 — agent commit:**

- [ ] Open AI chat; instruct agent to make a change and commit it
- [ ] History (filter: All) shows agent commit with `agent:` prefix + 🤖 icon per ADR §3.4a
- [ ] If missing: file follow-up issue for agent system prompt update

**Test 3 — branch + checkout + canvas/editor sync:**

- [ ] BranchPicker → create branch `experiment-1`
- [ ] On `experiment-1`: modify workflow YAML (remove a block) + modify custom block code in CodeEditor; commit
- [ ] Switch to `main` via BranchPicker → canvas reverts; CodeEditor reverts
- [ ] Switch back to `experiment-1` → canvas + CodeEditor update again

**Test 4 — GUI merge clean:**

- [ ] On `main`, BranchPicker → "Merge into current" → select `experiment-1`
- [ ] Result: clean or FF merge; verify Graph view topology

**Test 5 — filter:**

- [ ] Cycle filter dropdown (Manual milestones / All / Auto only); verify visibility flips
- [ ] GitGraph dims filtered commits to small grey dots per ADR §3.5c

**Test 6 — conflict via CLI, resolve via GUI:**

- [ ] CLI: `git checkout -b conflict-branch`, modify workflow YAML's same line differently, `git commit -am 'conflict edit'`, `git checkout main`
- [ ] GUI: BranchPicker → Merge → `conflict-branch`; verify MergeFlow shows "conflict" path
- [ ] ConflictResolveView opens; conflicted file opens in CodeEditor with `<<<<<< / ====== / >>>>>>` markers + inline action buttons
- [ ] Click Accept Both → Mark Resolved → Complete Merge
- [ ] Verify `git status` clean; merge commit in History

**Pass criteria:**

- [ ] **(a)** Commit button + branch CRUD + filter all functional
- [ ] **(b)** Auto-commit functional (`auto:` prefix; `runs.workflow_dirty = 0` after auto-commit)
- [ ] **(c)** Git graph renders correctly (lanes, edges, colors, branch labels)
- [ ] **(d)** Agent updates git via terminal; commit shows `agent:` prefix
- [ ] **(e)** Conflict resolution UI works (Monaco decorations, inline buttons, Mark Resolved → Complete Merge round-trip)
- [ ] **(f)** Branch checkout updates canvas + CodeEditor in sync
- [ ] **(g)** Conflict resolution finalizes clean merge commit visible in History
- [ ] GIF recorded

- [ ] Both tracking-branch `[DO NOT MERGE]` umbrella PRs remain open through e2e
- [ ] Every checkbox in this document checked with an artifact link
- [ ] Phase 4a all 6 pass-criteria green; agent system prompt issue filed if (f) failed

## Known issues queued for audit phase

### AI Block MCP-signal write/read race (deferred to D38-3.1b bug audit fix pass)

**Symptom.** Intermittent failures on **all** AIBlock skeleton tests that
write `signals/finish_ai_block.json` via the `StubAgent._emit` happy
path — most often on Python 3.11 (~1-in-30 frequency), occasionally on
3.13. Error surfaces as:

```
ValueError: AIBlock completion: malformed MCP signal at
  .../signals/finish_ai_block.json:
  Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)
```

Hits during the cascade (2026-05-15): #905 baseline, PR #926 (D38-2.2
Test py3.13), PR #931 (D38-2.3 Test py3.13), PR #940 (D39-2.3b Test
py3.11), PR #944 (D38-2.4c Test py3.11). Every hit cleared on
`gh run rerun --failed`. Issue #909 tracks the first-noticed symptom
but only describes one test.

**Root cause — TOCTOU race between writer and reader.**

- *Writer* (`tests/blocks/ai/conftest.py:103`, `StubAgent._emit`
  background thread): `(signals / "finish_ai_block.json").write_text(json.dumps(...))`.
  `Path.write_text` is **non-atomic**: it `open("w")` → truncates to 0
  bytes → `f.write(data)` → `f.close()`.
- *Reader* (`src/scieasy/blocks/ai/completion.py:152-157`,
  `CompletionWatcher.wait` polling loop, main thread):
  `if mcp_path.exists(): payload = json.loads(mcp_path.read_text(...))`.
  Raises `ValueError(... "malformed MCP signal ...")` on `json.JSONDecodeError`.

If the polling tick lands between the truncate and the write, the
reader sees a 0-byte file and `json.loads("")` raises
`JSONDecodeError: Expecting value: line 1 column 1` which the watcher
re-raises as `ValueError("... malformed MCP signal ...")` — fatal for
the test, but actually a transient artifact of non-atomic IO.

**Why PR #905 / #909 's fix did not solve it.** PR #905 only relaxed
the regex on `test_run_validation_fail_returns_error_state` from
`"is empty"` to `r"is empty|Expecting value|malformed MCP signal"`.
That test **intentionally** writes malformed JSON (`finish_via="error"`)
so the relaxed regex hides cross-stdlib message-format drift in that
one error-path test. It does nothing for the **happy-path** tests
(`test_run_writes_manifest_with_correct_shape`,
`test_run_request_pty_tab_with_safe_permission`, etc.), which were
never supposed to encounter a malformed-signal error in the first
place — those are racing on the writer's truncate window.

**Why Python 3.11 is more affected than 3.13.** GIL scheduling
granularity + stdlib IO buffering changed between versions; 3.11
surfaces the race window more often. Same code path can race on any
version.

**Fix plan (D38-3.1b bug-audit fix pass).** Apply A + B; leave the
reader strict.

| # | Change | File | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | Atomic write in `StubAgent._emit` | `tests/blocks/ai/conftest.py` `_emit()` around lines 102-103 (the `finish_via == "mcp"` branch and the `mark_done` branch) — use `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(dir=signals, delete=False)` + `os.replace(tmp, target)` | Closes the race in the test fixture; immediately stabilises CI |
| B | Atomic write in production MCP server | Wherever the real `mcp__scieasy__finish_ai_block` tool writes `finish_ai_block.json` (per ADR-035; locate via `grep -r finish_ai_block` and inspect the MCP tools module) — same `tempfile + os.replace` pattern | Avoids the same race biting real agent runs where AIBlock's polling and the MCP tool run in different processes |
| C | (NOT recommended) Reader-side retry | `src/scieasy/blocks/ai/completion.py:154` | Rejected: weakens watcher contract, masks future real bugs where writer crashes mid-write |

**Tests to add.** A regression test in `tests/blocks/ai/test_completion.py`
that asserts `CompletionWatcher.wait` survives a deliberately-induced
truncate-window race (use a wrapper that calls `open("w").close()` then
sleeps before writing the real JSON; without the fix the watcher must
