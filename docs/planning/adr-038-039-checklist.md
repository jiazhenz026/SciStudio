# ADR-038 + ADR-039 Implementation Checklist

> **Mandatory tracking doc.** Every agent edits the rows it owns and only those rows.
> Drift = protocol violation. The dispatcher (Claude as agent manager) sweeps after every phase.
> Plan file: `~/.claude/plans/whimsical-soaring-pascal.md`. Session start: 2026-05-15.

## Conventions

- `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · `[!]` blocked
- "Owner" is the agent role or "manager" for hands-on work
- Each row references the relevant ADR section in `[brackets]`
- When you tick a box, also append a one-line note: `→ <PR-or-commit-link>` or `→ <test-name passes>` or `→ <report-file-path>`
- Out-of-scope rules per agent are encoded in `docs/planning/dispatch-prompts/` (one prompt file per agent)

## Manager discipline (non-negotiable for this cascade)

1. Every `Agent` dispatch uses `isolation: "worktree"`, `model: "opus"`, `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`.
2. **MANDATORY (user direction 2026-05-15)**: After every Agent dispatch, the manager MUST immediately enter a foreground `until` loop polling for the next concrete artifact. Never reply "Waiting" and let the stop-hook fire repeatedly. Pattern: `until [ -n "$(git ls-remote origin '<branch-pattern>' 2>/dev/null)" ]; do sleep 60; done` or `until [ -f <report-path> ]; do sleep 60; done`.
3. Worktree isolation forbids `pip install -e .` from within the worktree (see `feedback_editable_install_contamination`).
4. Every `pytest` invocation uses `--timeout=60`. Plugin (`pytest-timeout`) is already in dev deps.
5. No `npm run dev` background processes — use `vitest run` and `npm run build`.
6. Every agent PR body contains `Closes #N`.
7. CI must be green before any agent reports done.
8. Mandatory live Chrome smoke for any UI-touching phase before report-done.
9. Codex P1/P2 findings on agent PRs override auditor "defer" calls — manager fixes in-PR per overnight merge protocol.
10. Tracking-branch convention: agent feature branches target the tracking branch (NOT main); umbrella PR `[DO NOT MERGE]` per track points to main for visibility only.

### Phase D39-2.5 — Polish + ADR-038 integration (Owner: ID39-5, 1 agent, sequential) [ADR-039 §6 Phase 4]

- [x] **Hard dependency**: D38-2.4c merged into `track/adr-038/lineage-db` AND D39-2.4b merged into `track/adr-039/git-versioning` → verified (commits 738dd11 + de9bdca)
- [x] Wires `runs.workflow_git_commit` to `git_engine.head_state()` inside `start_workflow` (replaces D39-2.2b TODO) → branch `feat/issue-954/d39-2-5-polish-integration`: `WorkflowRun.workflow_git_commit` field + defensive `lineage_store.set_pending_git_commit` hook for the Phase 4 final-merge
- [x] "Restore this run's workflow" button on Lineage tab calls `gitRestore({commit_sha, files: [workflow_yaml_path]})` → `frontend/src/components/Lineage/RunDetail.tsx` (NEW on 039 branch since 038's Lineage tab merges in at Phase 4); exports `RestoreWorkflowButton`, `runRestoreWorkflow`, `workflowYamlPathForRun`
- [x] Verifies ADR-035 AI Block / ADR-034 PTY agent flows emit commits with `agent:` prefix → grep confirmed neither `blocks/ai/ai_block.py` nor `engine/pty_control.py` invokes `GitEngine.commit()` directly today (commits originate from the MCP server wrapper + the agent's own shell inside the PTY); convention now cross-referenced in both module docstrings
- [x] Agent commit prefix convention documented in `docs/cli-integration.md` → already present from Phase 0 architecture refactor (CHANGELOG #904); module-level docstrings on `ai_block.py` + `pty_control.py` updated to cite ADR-039 §3.4a explicitly
- [x] ADR-039 status `proposed` → `accepted` (in `docs/adr/ADR-039.md`) → flipped, references D39-2.5 (issue #954)
- [ ] CI green; PR merged into tracking branch → PR pending

### Phase D39-3.1 — Combined audit (Owner: AD39-3, context-aware agent)

- [ ] Single audit agent dispatched (has session context per user spec)
- [ ] Verifies (a) skeleton-vs-ADR consistency, (b) impl-vs-design consistency, (c) wiring reliability
- [ ] **Mandatory live Chrome smoke**: commit / branch / merge / conflict resolution / graph render
- [ ] Codex auto-review reconciled for every D39 sub-issue PR
- [ ] Report at `docs/audit/2026-05-15-adr-039-combined-audit.md`

### Phase D39-3.2 — Fix (Owner: FD39, 1 agent)

- [ ] Manager classifies P1/P2; overrides auditor "defer" per overnight merge protocol
- [ ] Fix PR merged into `track/adr-039/git-versioning`; CI green

## Test phase checklist (e2e — manager runs in hotfix mode)

### Phase 4a — ADR-038 e2e (Chrome smoke)

- [ ] Chrome opens via `mcp__claude-in-chrome__tabs_create_mcp` → SciEasy GUI on free port
- [ ] Create new project `e2e-038`
- [ ] Generate synthetic bead TIFF (256×256, ~5 ellipses, ~6741 bright px; reuse fixture from ADR-036 e2e sub-test (d))
- [ ] Build workflow in GUI: `imaging.load_image → imaging.threshold(otsu) → imaging.save_image`
- [ ] Save workflow YAML; click Run **5 times**
- [ ] Click "Run from here" on `threshold` block once (creates 6th run with `execute_from_block_id`)
- [ ] Open Lineage tab

**Pass criteria:**

- [ ] **(a)** Each of 6 runs answers ADR-038's 4 user questions through Lineage tab UI: workflow YAML snapshot, block list with versions, per-block resolved params, per-block I/O DataObject references visible by clicking the row
- [ ] **(b)** "Run from here" run has `execute_from_block_id = "threshold_<n>"` and `parent_run_id` pointing to a prior run; upstream blocks greyed-out per ADR §3.6a
- [ ] **(c)** GUI visual check matches ADR §3.8 layout (two-pane runs list + run detail); click handlers respond correctly
- [ ] **(d)** "Export methods" produces markdown file matching `methods_export.py` template
- [ ] **(e1)** Delete `<project>/.scieasy/lineage.db` while GUI closed; reopen project; new empty db auto-created; Lineage tab shows "no runs yet" without crash
- [ ] **(e2)** Delete a block from canvas, save workflow, re-add the block, save again; Lineage tab still displays all prior runs (block_executions rows preserved)
- [ ] **(e3)** Delete workflow YAML file from disk; reopen project; Lineage tab still shows all prior runs of that workflow (workflow_yaml_snapshot inline in `runs` table per ADR §3.1 — confirms user's recollection)
- [ ] **(f)** Open AI chat in GUI; ask "Show me lineage for last 5 runs of image_pipeline — list each run's blocks, params, outputs"; agent writes SQL against `<project>/.scieasy/lineage.db`; compare to ground truth from direct `sqlite3` query
- [ ] **(f-followup)** If agent fails or hallucinates, file follow-up issue to update agent system prompt
- [ ] GIF recorded via `mcp__claude-in-chrome__gif_creator`

### Phase 4b — ADR-039 e2e (Chrome smoke)

- [ ] Create new project `e2e-039` with same bead workflow
- [ ] Add `hello_world` custom block via GUI (ADR-036 "New custom block" affordance), trivial pass-through body

**Test 1 — manual + auto + manual commits:**

- [ ] Click Commit button — manual commit 1 created
- [ ] Click Run — pre-run auto-commit: clean tree → no commit; force dirty edit → Run again → `auto:` commit fires
- [ ] Delete threshold block from canvas, save, click Commit — manual commit 2
- [ ] History panel with default filter "Manual milestones" shows 2 commits
- [ ] Filter "All" shows 3 commits (2 manual + 1 `auto:`)

**Test 2 — agent commit:**

- [ ] Open AI chat; instruct agent to make a change and commit it
- [ ] History (filter: All) shows agent commit with `agent:` prefix + 🤖 icon per ADR §3.4a
- [ ] If missing: file follow-up issue for agent system prompt update

**Test 3 — branch + checkout + canvas/editor sync:**

- [ ] BranchPicker → create branch `experiment-1`
- [ ] On `experiment-1`: modify workflow YAML (remove a block) + modify custom block code in CodeEditor; commit
- [ ] Switch to `main` via BranchPicker → canvas reverts; CodeEditor reverts
- [ ] Switch back to `experiment-1` → canvas + CodeEditor update again

**Test 4 — GUI merge clean:**

- [ ] On `main`, BranchPicker → "Merge into current" → select `experiment-1`
- [ ] Result: clean or FF merge; verify Graph view topology

**Test 5 — filter:**

- [ ] Cycle filter dropdown (Manual milestones / All / Auto only); verify visibility flips
- [ ] GitGraph dims filtered commits to small grey dots per ADR §3.5c

**Test 6 — conflict via CLI, resolve via GUI:**

- [ ] CLI: `git checkout -b conflict-branch`, modify workflow YAML's same line differently, `git commit -am 'conflict edit'`, `git checkout main`
- [ ] GUI: BranchPicker → Merge → `conflict-branch`; verify MergeFlow shows "conflict" path
- [ ] ConflictResolveView opens; conflicted file opens in CodeEditor with `<<<<<< / ====== / >>>>>>` markers + inline action buttons
- [ ] Click Accept Both → Mark Resolved → Complete Merge
- [ ] Verify `git status` clean; merge commit in History

**Pass criteria:**

- [ ] **(a)** Commit button + branch CRUD + filter all functional
- [ ] **(b)** Auto-commit functional (`auto:` prefix; `runs.workflow_dirty = 0` after auto-commit)
- [ ] **(c)** Git graph renders correctly (lanes, edges, colors, branch labels)
- [ ] **(d)** Agent updates git via terminal; commit shows `agent:` prefix
- [ ] **(e)** Conflict resolution UI works (Monaco decorations, inline buttons, Mark Resolved → Complete Merge round-trip)
- [ ] **(f)** Branch checkout updates canvas + CodeEditor in sync
- [ ] **(g)** Conflict resolution finalizes clean merge commit visible in History
- [ ] GIF recorded

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Phase 0 docs PR merged by user; main has refactored ARCHITECTURE.md + PROJECT_TREE.md + related ADRs
- [ ] All 21 sub-issue PRs merged into their tracking branches (D38: 10 PRs; D39: 10 PRs; minus one shared = ~20 PRs)
- [ ] Both tracking-branch `[DO NOT MERGE]` umbrella PRs remain open through e2e
- [ ] Every checkbox in this document checked with an artifact link
- [ ] Phase 4a all 6 pass-criteria green; agent system prompt issue filed if (f) failed
- [ ] Phase 4b all 7 pass-criteria green; agent system prompt issue filed if (d) failed
- [ ] Two final integration PRs (one per ADR) opened against main with conflict resolution in `runtime.py` + `store/index.ts`; user reviews + merges
- [ ] ADR-038 status `accepted`; ADR-032 status `superseded by ADR-038`; ADR-039 status `accepted`
- [ ] No drift: every tick has a corresponding artifact (commit, PR comment, test result, audit-report path) the manager can point to

## Out-of-scope from docs audit (filed as GitHub issues)

> Populated during Phase 0.75 from the docs-audit report. Each entry: audit excerpt → issue URL.

- **OOS-1** (P3-2 in audit): `PROJECT_TREE.md` line 83-84 still describes `core/proxy.py` as ViewProxy lazy-loading accessor, but ARCHITECTURE.md Appendix B (line 3256) marks ViewProxy eliminated by ADR-031. Pre-existing drift unrelated to ADR-038/039. → https://github.com/zjzcpj/SciEasy/issues/908
